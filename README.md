Description:

Hacking Water is a program to help people consume their daily goal of water consumption. Drinking the proper amount of water is a key component in living a healthy lifestyle. Many people find it hard to figure out or follow the correct level of water they should be drinking daily. With our program it helps you figure out the amount you should be drinking based on weight, exercise level, caffeine and alcohol consumption. It also helps you figure out by what time in your day you should be consuming a certain amount of water by considering your average  wake up time and average bedtime to help you stay on track to reach your daily goal.

How It Works:

Health guidelines state that one should drink 2/3rds of their body weight in ounces each day (ex. If one weighs 100 pounds, they should consume 66.6 ounces of water each day.) This number increases based on a number of outside factors including the amount of time one spends exercising per day (adds 2.4 ounces for every 5 minutes of exercise), and the amount of caffeine and alcohol one drinks in that day (adds 8 ounces for each caffeinated or alcoholic drink consumed.) The program works by prompting the user to enter all of this information, with some funny extra sections, and outputs how much water they should drink that day. The program also asks the user how long ago they last drank water, and based on that number and the amount they should drink per day and amount they have drank that day, and output when they should drink their next cup of water. This goes hand in hand with another feature which asks for one's wakeup time and bedtime and tells the user how many cups of water they should have consumed by the current time of day.
